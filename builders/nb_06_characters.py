with Venice AI. Eligibility: at least one full-time technical founder. The program
structure is 2 weeks of research, 4 weeks of build, 3 weeks of beta, and 3 weeks
of polish before Demo Day. Mentorship is weekly 45 minute sessions. The grant is
paid as $15k at week 1 and $10k at week 6. The program may lead a follow-on
pre-seed round of $250k to $1M for top performers. Demo Day is in San Francisco
and live-streamed. Each team gets 4 minutes to demo and 2 minutes of Q&A. Teams
keep all IP and the program takes no equity for the grant."""
