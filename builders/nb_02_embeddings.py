The Builder Program is a 12-week accelerator for teams shipping onchain consumer apps.
The cohort starts in Q3 and ends with a public Demo Day in Q4. Each accepted team
receives a $25k grant in USDC, weekly office hours with the program's engineering
partners, and credits with platforms including Venice AI, Privy, and Coinbase
Developer Platform.

Eligibility: teams must have at least one full-time technical founder, be incorporated
or willing to incorporate during the program, and commit to shipping a working app
on mainnet by Demo Day. Pre-product teams are welcome.

Program structure: weeks 1-2 focus on user research and product spec. Weeks 3-6 are
heads-down build. Weeks 7-9 are private beta with a target of 100 weekly active
users. Weeks 10-12 are growth, polish, and Demo Day prep.

Mentorship: every team is paired with two mentors, one from the program's engineering
side and one from the partner network. Mentor sessions are weekly, 45 minutes, and
recorded with consent. Office hours are open: any team can drop in to any session.

Funding: the $25k grant is paid in two tranches, $15k at week 1 and $10k at week 6
contingent on shipping milestones. The program may also lead a follow-on pre-seed
round of $250k-$1M for top performing teams at Demo Day. No equity is taken in
exchange for the grant or the program.

Demo Day: held in San Francisco and live-streamed globally. Each team gets a 4-minute
live demo and a 2-minute Q&A in front of an audience of investors, partners, and the
broader builder community. Teams are judged on traction, product quality, and onchain
volume in the 4 weeks leading up to Demo Day.

Privacy and credentials: teams keep all IP. Code can be open or closed source.
Partner credit balances are sandbox until you ship to mainnet, then upgraded.
